 *  Data Structure / Project 3
 * 
 * Description:
 *       the program implements the binary tree in Java
 *       I created 3 classes to handle the goal of this project
 *       which is creating a binary tree  from a text file , 
 *       implement methods to search for specific words, count their occurence 
 *       find the longest word in the tree, the most repeated words, the root and the deepest leaf of the tree
 *       implements method to find how many words are different in the tree, and how many words appear more than 20 times
 *       
 *       
 *       
 *       For this projects I use classes, public and private methods, variables, objects, for loops, 
 *       if else statements, setters, getters, and read text file , â€¦
